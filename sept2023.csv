Google Play,"A week ago posting music on my story and on notes was perfectly normal. Normal mainstream songs from people like Doja Cat we're showing up fine like normal, but as of a couple of days ago my music options started to show weird foreign music and songs from artist's I've never seen before which is really irritating and just frustrating. I've tried everything like reinstalling the app and logging out and back into my account and it did nothing. Please fix this.",1,23-09-23 14:18
Google Play,The app is quite good for socializing but it is distracting. It would be really great if there was an option in the settings to turn off the reels viewing as it is quite distracting and mentally draining. It would be really great if one could just come there to be connected and not get distracted by the reels.,5,13-09-23 14:18
Google Play,"I was unable to hear an audio when my friends posted it on their Instagram Feeds. It said 'audio unavailable'. Then, I tried to clear the cache but still, it didn't work out. Next, I updated the app but it didn't change anything. After that, I uninstalled the app and installed it again. The result? Nothing! To make it worse I can't send a comment on anyone's feed. It said that my activity got restricted until 21-09-2023 which is today but up until now, I can't send a comment.",1,03-09-23 14:18

Google Play,"For being a PICUTRE/VIDEO app, you think it'd let you resize your photos. If I have a photo that obviously needs to be in square format, why would you not have an option to fit the ENTIRE image in the square while maintaining scaling? It's so simple. On top of that, there's almost no point of saving drafts. Because when you go back to the same draft, it's corrupted 99% of the time and you have to start all over. Pretty ridiculous.",1,15-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"I've been using this app everyday for a decade, but recently it's gotten to the point it is unusable. Gifs don't show up in chats when you search for them, half of them are blank. When you do send one it is either invisible or cropped and crashes the app. I've also now lost the ability to post a real song to a story or note. All that shows up is strange royalty free music from overseas. I even tried to report a bug in-app, but that feature is also broken. Go figure.",1,18-09-23 0:00
Google Play,The app was working perfectly fine for the longest time and just randomly when I go to pick a song for my story it doesn't show all the ones that I have used before. Like when I look up a very popular or normal song before it would show up but now it doesn't show it at all for any songs. The app is completely updated and my phone's updated so I don't know what the issue is and they need to fix it because it's bad.,3,18-09-23 0:00

I am perfectly capable of deciding on my own when I want to refresh my feed. The number of ads and suggested posts seems to be steadily increasing. I follow people so I can actually look at their pics, not spend half an hour mostly scrolling past other stuff. App is steadily becoming worse.",3,06-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"App is overall decent and works well enough for me. It's been glitching though recently for me and multiple of my friends though via the post audio. Trying to add a song or listen to a song on a regular post that had it gives you the message ""Audio Unavailable"" when it's not since that would mean every song imagineable is unavailable for the normal posts. So, don't know what's up with that but it's frustrating since I like having that feature but now it's suddenly stopped working.",3,16-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"My only concerns with the app right now is music/audio that I want to add into my stories. My favorite artist, also one of the biggest bands so they should be on there, stopped popping up on my acct. I asked a friend to see if they come up on her end and they do so I'm wondering if it's a glitch after an update? Music has been giving me issues before this by either not playing or playing for 1-2 seconds and then stopping completely. I just need this fixed and not be such a headache.",2,17-06-23 0:00
Google Play,"So many bugs! I recently switched to Android and am surprised on how many glitches there are. Certain features appear and disappear when trying to post a story or reel, when you scroll past a reel or video it doesn't start over when you go back, so you have to wait for the whole thing to play before it loops again. Sometimes it freezes, I can't go back to my feed from the chats. Update: For days now it doesn't allow you to search music on stories and it stopped showing song names on other posts",3,24-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"After more than a decade, this app still has basic problems. You can feel free to turn the sound off on all videos, that is until you get a notification. When you click on the notification to read it, you will be forced to endure the sound of the video for the entirety of writing a reply or whatever else you're doing. This is an issue on iOS and Android. There is no foldable support. The experience is inconsistent from session to session. Hopefully a better app emerges eventually.",1,02-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"I'm using this on Bluestacks, and the compatibility of some features is a little wonky. For example, scrolling through and selecting multiple pictures in the ""add post"" feature is a little clunky. There's also no way to reorder the photos in a post once you've selected them, which means you have to resize and re-crop everything if you want to change the order. But, compatibility issues are to be expected when using an app for a phone on a desktop computer.",5,15-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"Overall experience is good but today i faced a problem regarding the songs for stories. The prob i faced is that i can't find any songs anymore, to be specific I've posted stuffs using the song ""murder on my mind"" but now i can't find it anymore. Instagram is only giving me a short list of specific songs for about 20 songs, i can't find any other songs except for those 20 songs. Please fix it.",3,21-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"I have dark mode turned on, but when I visit a link on Instagram, and then after I come back to the app, the screen goes white. The reels also lags if the video is fast paced? compared to slow motion videos that work fine.",3,16-09-23 0:00
Google Play,Their was a bug in the app from last 2 weeks and so many android users are going through this . I reported more than 10 times but their was no responce from team instagrame . so i decided to give it a zero star rating because now it is almost my 3rd week started from facing same bug . The bug is that my insta music is not properly working and not showing more songs . So many my friends are going through the same problem .... Shame on you Team Instagram,1,21-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"Whenever I join a call Instagram automatically shutdown the app and take time to rejoin. I have been facing a lot of issues these days , i can't see the post someone has send me , or when I text them i can't see what I texted until I go back to the homepage , and this is very frequent. I would really appreciate if Instagram do something about it",4,21-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"Android support is non existent. I don't even know how long this feature has been out but Android still doesn't have it. The ""Add yours"" feature in stories doesn't even exist for me at all and there isn't like a switch or a button to press to enable it. This is very sad and I wonder what else isn't supported or out for android yet that Apple already has...",2,26-09-23 0:00

Google Play,There is a bug in the pixel fold. The delete button for some posts don't show up. Same posts I checked on my iPhone and Samsung phone they are available only on the pixel they are not .. please fix.. I tried the app in folded and unfolded orientation same issue,3,16-09-23 0:00
Google Play,The filters and editing tools aren't really working because the editions are not posible to save. I can only upload and share pics just the way they are. Too bad.,2,18-09-23 0:00

Google Play,"Used to be good. Got worse with updates. You used to be able to see how many liked your pics. Not anymore. Used to be able to scroll through your time-line top to bottom. Not anymore. Now, it only shows you new posts. After that, you click ""view more"" or it fills your page with recommendations. Sometimes new posts you liked disappear, and you can only view them if you go to the post's followers page. Perfectly working app ruined. Just terrible.",1,05-09-23 0:00
Google Play,Before when I used it it was working fine but after a while I was not able to send pics to my friends like I can't also even use any filter and not able to see my own text then a new problem created I wasn't able to post anything and if it won't fixed then I will not able to use it so please fix it right now!,3,25-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"There is many bugs i can't find any of song or music artist and whenever i post picture in my story and wanna put a song for it ,the song option in the stories didn't show any song and not even the artist ,even in the reels and the posts it didn't show the songs and the song artist so i request instagram tofix this bug as fast as possible",1,17-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"Use to love this app, now I'm extremely disappointed the more updates it gets. I seriously can not stand how I can't see new posts anymore and discover new people. Now, all I can see in the tags are people who already have a heap of followers. Bring back recent posts! This was how I was getting the majority of my following was through tags. This app seems to be more and more about $$$ than the experience. Forcing small creators to pay for ads to get noticed is gross.",3,19-09-23 0:00
Google Play,This is the best app I have downloaded in my entire life ! Although I have a few complaints about unnecessary changing of the display it doesn't really matter that much. It has helped me to maintain relationships with people far away from places ! Love this app,5,20-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"Very poor enforcement when it comes to scam accounts or being hacked. If you ask me, I think Congress needs to enact a digital identities protection act as an extension of the Fair Credit Reporting Act because having accounts be taken over by scammers and Instagram refusing to intervene is like someone stealing your identity and can be very expensive especially if you're a legitimate business with a very vast following. They will never do the right thing on their own.",3,28-09-23 0:00
Google Play,"This app is good for those who signup for entertainment however, not very user-friendly to creators as it has a lot of glitches & no where to help. I am awaited for some competition to come in place so that I might switch to a better place to create.",2,09-09-23 0:00

App Store,"I have not received this update, although all of my friends have. I have tried to be patient, & I have also tried fixing it. I restarted my phone, I updated my phone, I deleted the app, I logged out of my account, I tried updating the app multiple times, & nothing. No music option on my notes. I don't understand why I am being excluded. I am hurt, & overall shocked that Instagram could exclude someone like this. I would appreciate if you would give me this update. I don't find it nice to be excluding anyone from your updates, & I don't know why you chose me to exclude. But it is unfair, and I would like to receive this update as soon as possible. I think I deserve this, especially after you never let me use the ""Add Yours"" stickers as well. I have since gotten over it, but now I cannot let you exclude me any longer. Please give me this update, I do not deserve this. It's truly disgusting & rude of you to just leave me out. I really want this update, I am so mad you chose to leave me out of this update, out of all of the updates you have made. I love music, & I really would like to put it on my notes.
